//Items in this category are food items that people actually eat. The key points are that they are created
//	already filled with reagents and are destroyed when empty. Additionally, they make a "munching" noise when eaten.

//Notes by Darem: Food in the "snacks" subtype can hold a maximum of 50 ml Generally speaking, you don't want to go over 40
//	total for the item because you want to leave space for extra condiments. If you want effect besides healing, add a reagent for
//	it. Try to stick to existing reagents when possible (so if you want a stronger healing effect, just use Tricordrazine). On use
//	effect (such as the old officer eating a donut code) requires a unique reagent (unless you can figure out a better way).

//The nutriment reagent and bitesize variable replace the old heal_amt and amount variables. Each ml of nutriment is equal to
//	2 of the old heal_amt variable. Bitesize is the rate at which the reagents are consumed. So if you have 6 nutriment and a
//	bitesize of 2, then it'll take 3 bites to eat. Unlike the old system, the contained reagents are evenly spread among all
//	the bites. No more contained reagents = no more bites.

//Here is an example of the new formatting for anyone who wants to add more food items.
